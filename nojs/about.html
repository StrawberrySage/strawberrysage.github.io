            <div>
                <p>hiya! i'm strawberrysage.<br>you can also call me sage, strawberry or strawbi for short.<br>i prefer not to share my real name online.</p>
                <p>i have suffered through the pain of learning how to program and i believe i have achieved wisdom. my code can still be a mess but that's irrelevant, who cares, roll the ads. i am god and you're a mere peasant.<br>bow down to me. muahahahahaha.</p>
                <p>jeez i gotta stop larping as a wise elder and actually do something with my life. it's honestly sad how little i've achieved.<br>i could make the "full time uni student" excuse but that's honestly bullshit. i've done plenty of coding but most of that consists of small toy projects which i create to learn shit.<br>did i mention the graveyard full of dead projects which <em>totally</em> never existed amirite? up high! down lo- ah~! too slow!</p>
                <p>so yeah, that's me, i guess.</p>
